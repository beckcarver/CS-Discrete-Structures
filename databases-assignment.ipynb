    "# Programming Assignment #2: Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will learn a little bit about databases by implementing some relational algebra operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases store data in a collection of **tables** or **relations**, which you can think of as Excel spreadsheets. \n",
    "For example, here is how some facts about some (hypothetical) students:\n",
    "\n",
    "| StudentId | FirstName | LastName | GPA |\n",
    "|:----------|:----------|:---------|----:|\n",
    "| W003      | Richard   | Baslim   | 2.7 |\n",
    "| W001      | Maureen   | Johnson  | 4.0 |\n",
    "| W012      | Lazarus   | Long     | 3.4 |\n",
    "| W014      | Lummox    | Lummox   | 2.1 |\n",
    "| W010      | Hazel     | Stone    | 2.9 |\n",
    "| W006      | Dejah     | Thoris   | 3.4 |\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: What does this have to do with **relations** as discussed in class? It turns out that **relational databases** are all about relations! The first table above is a relation, in the sense that it is a subset of the cross product of StudentIds, FirstNames, LastNames, and GPAs. Those are names, but really what we mean is the crossproduct of the possible types: alphanum x alpha x alpha x rational.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of relational databases is the notion of a **schema**, which describes the names of the tables, columns, and the types of the columns. For example, the table above may be called STUDENTS, the column names are listed in the headings, and the column types are described in the note above. There is more to schemas, but we'll ignore that in this assignment."

    "## TODO-0 (no points): Data Definitions and Sample Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how we can represent that table, and some others, in ACL2. Note how the type information in the schema can be described using `defdata`. (We ignore the column names here and use column indexes instead.) Note how we define detailed schema information for each table and also give a \"generic\" table definition; the operators we'll be defining work on generic tables. There's nothing to do here, but be sure to execute this cell to initialize the data we'll be using later."
