    "# Programming Assignment #3: Propositional Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will work with propositional expressions (i.e., trees) and transformations that turn one expression into a different, but equivalent expression. E.g., turn $p \\vee true$ into just $true$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Propositional expressions look like one of the following:\n",
    "* a constant, which must be either `t` or `nil`\n",
    "* a propositional variable, which must be a valid symbol, e.g., `p` or `q12`\n",
    "* `(NOT     expr1)`\n",
    "* `(OR      expr1 expr2)`\n",
    "* `(AND     expr1 expr2)`\n",
    "* `(IMPLIES expr1 expr2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `expr1` and `expr2` are propositional expressions. For example, this is a propositional expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (implies (and p (or q r)) (or p q))\n",
    "    \n",
    "## TODO-1 (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to use `defdata` to implement the type `prop-expr` for propositional expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint: Valid symbols can be recognizred with the ACL2 type `:symbol`, similar to `:nat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Remark: Just in case you missed it, this data structure is a *tree*, and when trees are used in this context they are usually called *expression trees*."

For this todo item, you should define this map data type and a function `(get-value sym bindings)` that returns the current value of `sym` in the given `bindings`. If the given symbol is not given a value in the bindings, default to something, e.g., `nil`.\n",

Whatever value this returns (and it makes sense to just return the first value found) is, by definition, **the** value of the variable at this time."
