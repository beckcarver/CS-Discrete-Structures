But this is not true for the upper bound, namely that $\\zeta_2(n) < \\frac{3.1416^2}{6}$. In this case, we keep adding fractions as $n$ increases, so it is not so easy to see that no matter how many fractions we add, the total sum is still less than $\\frac{3.1416^2}{6}$.\n",

You can read about it at [Wikipedia's page for the \"Basel Problem\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem#Euler's_approach). His solution is very clever, but it does not involve any math beyond the prerequisites for this course!"
