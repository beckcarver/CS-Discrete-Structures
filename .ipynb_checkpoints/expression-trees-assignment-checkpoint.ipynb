    "# Programming Assignment #3: Expression Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression tree is a tree where internal nodes are operators and the leaves are either variables or constants. For example, here is an expression tree that corresponds to the expression `2-3*x`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (MINUS 2 (TIMES 3 x))\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will \n",
    "1. Write an evaluator for expression trees, e.g., the value of the tree above is `-28` when `x=10`.\n",
    "2. Perform some simple optimizations, e.g., `(MINUS 2 (TIMES (PLUS 1 2) x))` simplifies to the expression above.\n",
    "3. Show that the optimizations are correct, i.e., that they return the same values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: You may know that the Java/C++/C#/whatever compiler you use **optimizes** the generated code. In this assignment you will get a feel for what an optimizing compiler does. Coincidentally, the next section introduces the ACL2 `LET*` syntax, and that turns out to be very similar to a code represerntation called *static single assignment (SSA)* that is often used in compilers for optimization. You can learn more about this if you take the compilers course!\n"
